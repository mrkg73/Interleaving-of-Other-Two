Give three strings s1, s2 and s3, determine if s3 is formed by interleaving s1 and s2.
A string s3 is an interleaving of s1 and s2 if:

It contains all characters of s1 and s2 while preserving their relative order.
Characters from s1 and s2 appear in s3 in the same order as in their original strings.
The length of s3 equals the combined length of s1 and s2.
